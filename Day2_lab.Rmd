# Create a package (only if you missed Day 1)

1. Create the package file structure by typing the following in the Console. Choose the path carefully so that you don't create a package inside another project. 

```{r}
library(devtools)
create_package("~/covidtime")  # you can change the path
```

Your RStudio session will now switch to the new `covidtime` package project.


2. Create a new R script, type in the following function, and save it as `day.R` in the R folder:

```{r}
whatdayisit <- function() {
  format(Sys.Date(), "%A, %B %d, %Y")
}
```
