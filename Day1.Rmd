# What are packages?

-   Collections of code

# Where are they stored?

-   CRAN

-   GitHub

-   BioConductor

-   Your hard drive

# How to install

-   from CRAN:

```{r}
install.packages("assertthat")
```



```{r}
install.packages("RLadiesnyc")
```

-   from GitHub:

```{r}
devtools::install_github("jtr13/ggformat")
```

```{r}
devtools::install_github("jtr13/ggformat", force = TRUE)
```

Many packages are available both on CRAN and GitHub:

"dev version"

```{r}
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/forcats")
```

-   from your hard drive:

```{r}
devtools::install("~/ggformat")
```

Regardless of the method, the packages are *installed* -- see Packages -->

# What is a "source" package?

```{r}
fs::dir_tree("~/ggformat")
```

```{r}
list.files("~/ggformat")
```

# Why use projects?

So you never have to use `getwd()` or `setwd()` again. You're always just in the right place.


# Loading vs. installing

Usually we use `library()` to load packages into memory. While developing a package we use `devtools::load_all()`.

- It doesn't show up in the list of packages (or at least the version under development doesn't.)

- The functions are in memory and will disappear if we restart R.


# Creating a package

We need some essential files: `DESCRIPTION` and a folder called `R` with `.R` files.

The easier way to create the structure is with `create_package()`:

```{r}
library(devtools)
create_package("~/covidtime")
```

# YOUR TURN

See [Day1_lab.md](Day1_lab.md)

# Using the package in another project / script

Before we can use the package elsewhere we need to:

- add function documentation by clicking "Code... Insert Roxygen Skeleton" (or at a minimum include `@export`)

- edit DESCRIPTION

- document with `devtools::document()`

- install the package with `devtools::install()`


# YOUR TURN

See [Day1_lab.md](Day1_lab.md)

# Package states

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/installation.png")
```

Key points:

* `devtools::install()`:  source --> installed

* `install.packages()`: binary --> installed 

* Developers submit *bundles* to CRAN, CRAN builds and distributes *binaries*
